Write C program is a way to create a stack using an array. Performs operations such as push, pop, and stack values, and displays the messages that appear in each function.

Functions that you must write:

     push()

     This function takes an integer as input and puts it on the stack.
     If the stack is full, "Stack Overflow." will be displayed and the program will end.

     pop()

     This function pops data at the top of the stack.
     If the stack is empty, "Stack Underflow." will be displayed and the program will end.

     show()

     This function is used to display the value of the stack.
     If the stack is empty, "Stack is empty." is displayed and the program ends.

     isFull()

     This function checks whether the stack is full or not.
     It returns true if top is equal to max_size - 1, indicating the stack is full, otherwise it returns false.

     isEmpty()

     This function checks if the stack is free.
     It returns true if top equals -1, indicating the stack is empty, otherwise it returns false.

Input
First line: Input an integer representing the size of the stack, where 1 ≤ size ≤ 100000000. If the input value is less than or equal to 0, "Please enter a positive number." is printed and the program ends.
Second line:
Input Integer 1, 2, 3, 4
1 is Push
2 is Pop
3 is Show Stack
4 is Exit
If you type 1, you must type it followed by the integer you want to add to the stack.
If you type 2, the number in the stack will be subtracted by the 1st unit.
If you type 3 it will display the entire stack and end the program.
If you type 4, you will exit the program and type "Exiting..."
If you type anything other than 1 - 4, "Invalid choice." will be printed and the program will end.
