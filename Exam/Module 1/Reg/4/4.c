// Create a structure for the node in the Priority Queue by collecting data and Priority Next, which points to the next Node for the Priority value.If the data is small, it is very priority and the data is very valuable.

// For putting data into the Priority Queue, with the order according to the Priority
void enqueue(){

}

// For removing data from Priority Queue
void dequeue(){

}

// For the first data returns, Priority Queue
void peek(){

}

// For showing all the information in the Priority Queue
void display(){

}

// For finding the minimum results of the second number from the combination of numbers in Array
// For example, if the number in Array is {6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3} will have the least positive results, which are 604, which is a positive result of 2, 358 and 246
// 1. Announcement of Priority Queue variable using the name "PQ" D
// 2. Declaring 2 full variables, using the name 'Num1' and 'Num2' for creating two base numbers from the numbers in Array.
// 3. Put all the numbers in the Array into the Priority Queue (the numbers must be arranged from very little).
// 4. Take the number from the Priority Queue to continue as the most white of the number that is stored in the NUM1 variable, for example, if the value in NUM1 is 12 and the number that is taken out of the Priority Queue is 3 values in the NUM1 will become 123.
// 5. If Priority Queue still has informationTake the information from the Priority Queue to continue as the most white of the number stored in the variable Num2.
// 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Priority Queue doesn't have information.
// 7. Calculating the sum of numbers in Num1 and Num2 as well as return.
int minSum(){

}
// 1. Get N, which is the size of Array that is used to store numbers.
// 2. Create array for collecting integers to size N.
// 3. Get a number of 0 - 9 Number N, the value and keep in Array.
// 4. Call the Minsum function for calculating the total results from Array.
// 5. Show results from calling the Minsum function
int main (){

}

// input: Number of members in Array and members' values in Array
// output
// Line 1: Show the value in the Priority Queue. All 3 times after the EnQueue. The information is transparent in the Priority Queue. It is the first 3 data in the input array.
// Line 2: Show yourself in the Priority Queue's front position.
// Line 3: Show the value in the Priority Queue. After 2 times
// Line 4: Show the results of the Minsum function.
// If the N value is 0, show the message "Invalid"

// Test Case 1
// Input
// 0
// Output
// Invalid

// Test Case 2
// Input
// 6
// 6 8 4 5 2 3
// Output
// 4 6 8
// 4
// 8
// 604
