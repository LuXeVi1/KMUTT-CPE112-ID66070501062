Write a C program for the average of the numbers in each Matrix, by calculating the value of the current location 1 and the values surrounded by 8 values and does not need to find the average number of numbers that have a man's position.The process of calculating the following
Input Matrix:
[
    1,1,1,2,2,2,
    3,3,3,4,4,4,
    1,1,1,2,2,2,
    3,3,3,4,4,4
]

- The edge numbers that do not need to find the average value consisting of numbers in the 1st row, column 1, row 4 and Com 4
- The position that must be calculated is the row that has 2, 3 columns 2,3,4,5

1.1 Start the calculation of the average of the number 2, Com 2, using 9 numbers of numbers divided by 9
(1+1+1+3+3+1+1+1)/9 = 1 (use the whole number)
1.2 Instead of the value of that position with the average calculating
1.3 Move to calculate the average of the number 2 position. Column 3
(1+1+2+1+3+4+1+2)/9 = 1 (use the whole number)
1.4 Instead of the value of that position with the calculation of the averageThen calculate the remaining numbers until the results are as follows
[
    1,1,1,2,2,2,
    3,1,1,2,2,4,
    1,1,2,2,2,2,
    3,3,3,4,4,4
